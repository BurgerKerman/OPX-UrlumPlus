		Doppler = This body oddly looked a lot like a teeny-tiny Duna. How it got there, we have no idea; we thought this was dust. Let's just call it Doppler, because it sounds nice.
		Dyva = Wait... there's a moon here?! How the heck did that ever happen around such a small body? Oh well, might as well call it Dyva; it sure did deviate from our expectations.
		Quazen = This asteroid's oddly high up in the sky... and it almost seems like there's two things, when you analyze the light. Maybe we should see about referencing the long-forgotten god of Quazen.
		Palloocus = Strange... a little white speck not far behind Jool, bright enough that we could see it. Let's call this Palloocus, in honor of the late king.
		Palloomus = A red object here? Wow. Perhaps we should call this Palloomus, after Palloocus' brother.
		Euribanne = It's a teeny asteroid running ahead of Jool. Perhaps this should be called Euribanne, after Jool's father.
		Eurbon = A cute little moon around that asteroid, we see? Something to help the mother of running around... perhaps the famous Eurbon Kerman could use a dedication.
		Pab = It's pretty far out there, but somehow light enough that a kid discovered it. It's on a decently interesting orbit too, but not too bad. For her sake, let's call this Pab, like the sound she made finding it.
		Pymm = So, it turns out Pab has a companion here? Let's name it Pymm, like Pab's pet dog in The Saltwater Taffy.
		Lemus = We have found among the most distant objects yet. It seems extremely large, almost planet-sized. Perhaps a name like this should go to its discoverer... who named it Lemus, after... himself. Cool.
		Hizie = Giant red object, tiny blue object! Lemus decided to name this after his loving wife Hizie, despite her flattered objections.
		Pava = It turns out Lemus is much smaller than we thought--through the glare of... something, we managed to find a little body called Pava. Perhaps Lemus isn't as big as we thought.
