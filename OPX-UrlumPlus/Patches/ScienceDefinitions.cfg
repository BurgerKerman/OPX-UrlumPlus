	@RESULTS
	{
		QuazenSrfLandedBlue = The surface of this lobe seems to have pockets of sapphire out of the rest of the beryllium. This sapphire must have been dredged up due to geological activity of some sort.
		QuazenSrfLandedMontes = These mountains seem to have much looser rock than the rest of Turq's Lobe; it's essentially a snowy dirtball.
		QuazenSrfLandedSlopes = The rock gets thinner--and slipperier--as you ascend the mountain range.
		QuazenSrfLandedLake = The surface here is covered with sapphires. You pick up the purest one you can find, then realize that you cannot call your jeweler to make a ring. You guess the spouse will have to wait...
		QuazenSrfLandedGold = The surface here seems flaky, like it's covered in powdered sulfur. You think of the smell it will bring about when you return to the ship, and then wonder if the sample came from Pol as well.
		QuazenSrfLandedDivot = There seems to be a bit of sulfur here, but it also is mixied with phosphorus of some kind. There is tons of rock beneath the dusty surface, however.
		QuazenSrfLandedCrater = The rock here seems to be heavily compressed from the violent impact, but it is oddly lacking in the dust that spread to the rest of the hemisphere.
		QuazenSrfLandedInterlobe = Tidal stresses... make this... terrible... to dig into!
		QuazenSrfLandedNorthPole = Whatever body impacted this region had to have left some sort of tholin deposits. But how they survived a body that came from so far away remains to be seen.
		QuazenSrfLandedSouthPole = Some slightly harder rock here, but some that doesn't need phenomonal strength to even make budge.

		EuribanneSrfLandedLowlands = The composition here seems to be similar to ice, though there is still some rock there. It may have come from the same region as Vant.
		EuribanneSrfLandedMidlands = This layer may be mostly dust, with tiny ice crystals throughout.
		EuribanneSrfLandedHighlands = There's a lot to take in here. It's just like shoveling dirt on a construction site, except a lot easier.
		EuribanneSrfLandedCraters = The craters seem a bit icier; perhaps these impacts may have deposited that ice.
		EuribanneSrfLandedDivot = This crater sure was giant. It's filled with ice. No wonder Euribanne's a little off-kilter!
		EuribanneSrfLandedDoubleDouble = These craters seem to be filled with tholins. Perhaps two objects beyond Neidon came here and impacted the object.
		EuribanneSrfLandedChasm = The rock here is much denser than the surrounding material. Did Euribanne shrink during its formation, or was this a product of geological activity?
		EuribanneSrfLandedNorthPole = There's a rich, rich deposit of tholins here... and yet this crater is so deep.
		EuribanneSrfLandedSouthPole = Somewhat icy in composition, as if the Divot caused a major "lava" flow of some kind that later cooled.
		
		EurbonSrfLandedCraters = Deposits of ice at the bottom here. These may have been pretty slow impacts though.
		EurbonSrfLandedLowlands = Still relatively icy, but there's a decent enough layer of rock to keep everything in line.
		EurbonSrfLandedMidlands = This is mainly ice, ice not strong enough to hold boulders or anything along those lines.
		EurbonSrfLandedHighlands = There's a lot more rock here, with some hints of ice. It's still dusty rock, however.
		EurbonSrfLandedPeaks = The ice seems to be partially packed in here, covered instead by large bits of rock.
		EurbonSrfLandedPits = The sample is incredibly sparse here somehow. Whatever formed these pits, it wasn't craters.

		PalloocusSrfLandedBloodCrater = It's tholins all the way down.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCraters = Underneath a fresh layer of powdered ice is a layer of tholins.
		PalloocusSrfLandedNorthHemi = A healthy mix of ice and tholins, enough to feed a whole Tektonic family!
		PalloocusSrfLandedSouthHemi = Mostly water ice here, but there's a healthy amount of rock here as well.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCanyon = This entire canyon seems to be less icy than the rest of the area... possibly because ice deposited from the giant impact may not have actually made it down here.
		PalloocusSrfLandedBlue = The ice here is especially thick. Possibly just from where the last bits settled around the area, maybe for rebalancing.
		PalloocusSrfLandedVolcano = This seems to be fresh ice, mostly untouched by cosmic rays and the solar wind. This world must be volcanically active... but how?
		
		PalloomusSrfLandedLowlands = There doesn't seem to be a ton of tholins here; mostly lots of water ice.
		PalloomusSrfLandedMidlands = A thicker layer of tholins here, but scooping some away reveals further water ice beneath.
		PalloomusSrfLandedHighlands = Mass quantities of tholins. Any ice here must have been removed a long time ago.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCraters = There's less tholins here than the surrounding area. These craters must be fairly recent geologically.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCliff = This may not have gotten much ice from Palloocus' collision, strangely enough. And whatever ice is here is extremely packed.
		PalloomusSrfLandedSnowdrifts = This ice is incredibly fresh. Palloocus' collision sure did happen fairly recently.

		DopplerSrfLandedCrater = This doesn't seem like rust... more like tholins, which can only form out near the region beyond Jool...
		DopplerSrfLandedMainland = Somewhat of a mix of rust and tholins. Kinda hard to chip through.
		DopplerSrfLandedEquator = This seems to be made of ice, mixed with some silver and other metals for good measure.
		
		DyvaSrfLandedMajorLobe = It's very crumbly. Just like a butter cookie.
		DyvaSrfLandedMinorLobe = It's very crumbly. Just like a butter cookie.
		DyvaSrfLandedContactPoint = Extremely dense. It's like you're trying to flay off skin.

		QuazenSrfLanded = Wow. What a ride here.
		QuazenSrfLandedBlue = It's blue and white all over. You're suddenly green... well, greener... with envy.
		QuazenSrfLandedMontes = From this vantage point, both lobes of Quazen are visible. The contrast is incredible!
		QuazenSrfLandedSlopes = The peaks are so white from here...
		QuazenSrfLandedLake = There is water at the bottom of the ocean; there is sapphire at the bottom of the lake. How?!
		QuazenSrfLandedGold = The rocket engines must have kicked up some dust from the surface; it's floating all around you.
		QuazenSrfLandedDivot = The rocket engines must have kicked up some dust from the surface; it's floating all around you.
		QuazenSrfLandedCrater = Here you see one of the deepest craters ever seen. How Quazen didn't fall apart after this is a mystery for the ages.
		QuazenSrfLandedInterlobe = Between the blue and the gold... is just a plain field of gray.
		QuazenSrfLandedNorthPole = A red north pole, huh? It feels like Festivus has returned.
		QuazenSrfLandedSouthPole = We don't really know what went on here, but the craters seemed to be shaped like teardrops. Somewhat like the tears you cried after finally managing to reach the body...

		EuribanneInSpaceHigh = As the asteroid spins ever-so-slowly, you find it's somewhat off-kilter. You don't know why exactly, but it does make you somewhat uneasy.
		EuribanneInSpaceHigh = The views of Jool from here are spectacular, even if it's only half as bright as it normally should be.
		EuribanneInSpaceLow = Orbiting around here, with teeny little Eurbon nearby, makes the whole ride here worth it. This despite the fact that this asteroid is barely any bigger than Gilly.
		EuribanneSrfLanded = This landing reminds you of a landing on Gilly. Gilly, but icy...
		EuribanneSrfLandedDivot = This place might be a bit slippery once you go on EVA. It doesn't look like a very safe place.
		EuribanneSrfLandedNorthPole = Dark, dark in the daytime. You miss Eurbon.
		EuribanneSrfLandedChasm = You don't know how you landed here. Or how this even got here. It's the strangest place in the system yet.

		EurbonInSpaceHigh = This moon rotates slowly, but it's a welcome sight compared to the sluggishness that is Euribanne's rotation.
		EurbonInSpaceLow = It's a cute little moon, sure, but there isn't much to see. It could be a fragment from a collision that may have caused Euribanne's divot.
		EurbonSrfLanded = It's kind of flat and smooth, but not too hard to see. Not very bouldery.
		EurbonSrfLandedCraters = These are somewhat icy. You're lucky these may have been low-velocity impacts; otherwise they would have shattered the moon altogether.
		EurbonSrfLandedPeaks = These are lighter for some reason than the mainland. Why that is remains to be seen.
		EurbonSrfLandedPits = You're way in deep. It's a miracle you even landed in here.

		PalloocusInSpaceHigh = The red Palloomus looms over you as you look at Palloocus. You wonder how it is that two incredibly different bodies could end up so close together.
		PalloocusInSpaceHigh = The views of Jool from here are spectacular, even if it's only half as bright as it normally should be.
		PalloocusInSpaceHigh = Palloocus and Palloomus slowly orbit around each other, both keeping one face to each other. Just like dancing twins.
		PalloocusInSpaceLow = McCartney Montes and Sangue Crater especially stand out to you. Whatever volcanism there was must have been driven by the impact.
		PalloocusSrfLanded = Whatever you might have landed in is too fluffy to think about. It's like fresh powder.
		PalloocusSrfLandedBloodCrater = This may be the reddest place in the Solar System, even moreso than Duna. But hey, at least Duna's easier to reach.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCanyon = This is certainly an odd place to land, but the vistas from here are still pretty nice.
		PalloocusSrfLandedVolcano = The light here would be blinding if this were any closer to the Sun. Though the reflection of the light would honestly be the least of your worries...
		
		PalloomusInSpaceHigh = High above the red asteroid, you see its white brother not far away. It's a striking difference.
		PalloomusInSpaceLow = That cliff sure seems to be tall. It shouldn't be too drastic of a drop though.
		PalloomusSrfLanded = All around you is red. Dark, dark red. It's a pleasant red though, like cake.
		PalloomusSrfLandedLowlands = It's kinda brighter here in comparison, possibly because of the icy ejecta nearby.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCliff = It's such a long way down.
		PalloomusSrfLandedSnowdrifts = It's really fresh ice here, almost powdery. Some of it sublimated from the heat of the rocket.

		DopplerInSpaceHigh = It's really, really red... like Duna's polar opposite.
		DopplerInSpaceLow = From this vantage point, the surface seems more like powder, like a really thick strawberry cookie.
		DopplerSrfLandedCrater = The dust flew off as you landed. What is this on here?
		DopplerSrfLandedMainland = Looks somewhat dusty here. Whatever's here must be really rubbly.
		DopplerSrfLandedEquator = Too powdery here. Almost like snow... so how come it hasn't sublimated?
		
		DyvaInSpaceHigh = With Doppler in the background, you can't help but see this as an odd sort of moon.
		DyvaInSpaceLow = You don't know how two asteroids could have come together at such a tiny speed, let alone come into orbit around another asteroid.
		DyvaSrfLandedMajorLobe = The ground buckles a bit under the ship... And then bounces back. Then buckles again.
		DyvaSrfLandedMinorLobe = The ground buckles a bit under the ship... And then bounces back. Then buckles again.
		DyvaSrfLandedContactPoint = How you landed between these two lobes is a mystery for the ages.

		QuazenInSpaceLow = Glints of light from the lake-like region. Is this water?
		QuazenSrfLandedBlue = All you can see is just... blue. You then start humming some old song to yourself.
		QuazenSrfLandedMontes = You can jump off pretty high and see both of the lobes. The gravity must be really strong in the interlobe regions.
		QuazenSrfLandedSlopes = The footsteps are starting to have some give. It's getting fluffy up here...
		QuazenSrfLandedLake = On Kerbin, these sapphires would have either been crushed underneath you or cut you up like a bunch of tiny knives. Here, it's kind of like a really bouncy gravel trail.
		QuazenSrfLandedGold = You kick up some dust from the surface, but it does at least rain back down. You wipe some off your helmet.
		QuazenSrfLandedDivot = Here the dust is somewhat light; at neck depth, you'll hit bedrock.
		QuazenSrfLandedCrater = The towering cliffs from the crater are ridiculous vistas. You take a photo just for personal enjoyment.
		QuazenSrfLandedInterlobe = You can feel yourself getting heavier here. It must be a major achievement to be able to walk up to either of the lobes.
		QuazenSrfLandedNorthPole = Yes, just like Festivus.
		QuazenSrfLandedSouthPole = Like tears in rain.

		EuribanneInSpaceHigh = It's a teeny little asteroid with a teeny little moon, with a teeny speed of rotation. You wonder why you even came out here in lieu of Jool.
		EuribanneInSpaceLow = Euribanne certainly is a strange little thing. It's almost like Bop, except small. Maybe it was a fragment?
		EuribanneSrfLanded = There's a pretty big layer of dust and rocks here. A bit like snow in a way, except it doesn't give when you try to walk on it.
		EuribanneSrfLandedDivot = You're lucky your boots are designed for traction. One wrong step and you could be slipping and falling. Not onto the asteroid, but around it.
		EuribanneSrfLandedChasm = What a view, what a view, what an imposing view! You can't help but take a picture.
		EuribanneSrfLandedNorthPole = You can't see a thing from here. It's like a mini Mohole.
		EuribanneSrfLandedCraters = Ever-so-subtly icy here. Ice is nice.
		EuribanneSrfLandedDoubleDouble = These craters are rather red, and rather big. It reminds you of the snowkerbs you used to build.
		
		EurbonInSpaceHigh = You see an odd-looking face here on the moon. Even despite the spongy look, it's still somewhat cute.
		EurbonInSpaceLow = This moon is too cute to not love. You snap a picture for the memes, and for a funeral picture when it inevitably decays into Euribanne.
		EurbonSrfLanded = This is kind of a normal little lump of rock... well, aside from the deep pits and the incredible views of Euribanne.
		EurbonSrfLandedCraters = The rims are pretty nice from here. Not too big, not too small. Euribannerise must be exiting...
		EurbonSrfLandedPeaks = Euribanne looks amazing from here. You would jump for joy, but then you'd be on an escape trajectory.
		EurbonSrfLandedPits = You're in a hole you can't dig yourself out of. But you can jump out of it.

		PalloocusInSpaceHigh = Despite their differences, these twins seem to love each other. It's a cute dance.
		PalloocusInSpaceHigh = Palloocus is nearly pure white. Incredible. It has to be fresh ice... at least, geologically fresh ice.
		PalloocusInSpaceLow = You think about trying to skid to a halt in the ice... and then you realize you thought it out loud. Mission Control is going to have a field day...
		PalloocusSrfLandedBloodCrater = You feel like you're climbing to the poles of Duna right now... and then you realize the poles are all around you.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCraters = These are nice places to relax. They feel really fluffy, whether they be from tholins or otherwise.
		PalloocusSrfLandedNorthHemi = It's pretty pink up here. You brush away the ice, see a thick layer of tholins.
		PalloocusSrfLandedSouthHemi = Why, this is almost like a dirty snowball. If only you could make one.
		PalloocusSrfLandedCanyon = You love the vistas here. You try to look for Euribanne from here, only to find nothing.
		PalloocusSrfLandedBlue = You're green. But you still feel blue here. You like the blue ice. It's almost glowing here.
		PalloocusSrfLandedVolcano = These volcanoes are towering over you, but they're still somewhat easy climbs due to the low gravity. You wonder if you could ride a wave of liquid water, if it were to come out.

		PalloomusInSpaceHigh = This is strikingly red. Shockingly red, even. It's like you took a giant handful of cake and plopped it in space.
		PalloomusInSpaceLow = You think of that cliff, and how far it would take you to fall down that, at least when compared to on Kerbin.
		PalloomusSrfLanded = The redness hasn't changed one bit here. It's just like Palloocus' crater.
		PalloomusSrfLandedLowlands = It's slightly brighter, you guess. But not severely bright.
		PalloomusSrfLandedCliff = You feel a sudden urge to get a stopwatch and time how long it takes you to fall.
		PalloomusSrfLandedSnowdrifts = It's powdery here. You can see your footprints as you launch into the air.

		DopplerInSpaceHigh = Doppler reminds you of Grandma's cookies. They were awful cookies.
		DopplerInSpaceLow = This asteroid feels like Duna, but wrong. So wrong.
		DopplerSrfLandedCrater = Your footsteps seem to be somewhat rigid on here. But a little kick of a loose rock gives it its second, more transient moon.
		DopplerSrfLandedMainland = It feels like a fragment of Duna, except if you jumped you would head straight into orbit.
		DopplerSrfLandedEquator = This is white. How white.
		
		DyvaInSpaceHigh = Your mouth waters just looking at this.
		DyvaInSpaceLow = If space weren't a vacuum, you'd be tasting the surface right now.
		DyvaSrfLanded = Your stomach feels strange. Is this because it looks like a cookie, or because you feel something right underneath you?

		PalloocusInSpaceLow = Nothing really changes as a result of the opening of the bay, but you do know now that the surface is made mainly of water ice.
		PalloocusSrfLanded = There's now a patch of odd materials for future missions to never be able to detect.

		PalloomusInSpace = Palloomus may be made of tholins for sure, and the water ice samples do seem to be very similar to that of Palloocus. A reasonable investigation to be sure.

		Palloomus = That's not a very magnetic body at all.

		Doppler = Observe, the magnetism of a top.

		DyvaInSpace = Magnetic analysis reveals an anomalously high content of iron, depsite relatively low density.
		DyvaSrfLanded = This iron seems to be moving around, but there's no true magnetic field to be seen.
