		Dathil = Hey look, it's another Polta! Said no one ever. This is going to be very interesting to explore. Let's call it Dathil after the idiotic fairy from Kakespeare's stories. I'm sure this won't start a trend.
  		Lyxis = What is this thing DOING out there? Its so far away and so inclined that theres no way it formed there. Was it captured or flung out? Let's name it Lyxis. Why? I dunno.
  		Pab = It's pretty far out there, but somehow light enough that a kid discovered it. It's on a decently interesting orbit too, but not too bad. For her sake, let's call this Pab, like the sound she made finding it.
		Pymm = So, it turns out Pab has a companion here? Let's name it Pymm, like Pab's pet dog in The Saltwater Taffy.
